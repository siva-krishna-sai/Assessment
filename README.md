Saffron Aroma Café Chatbot - Zephyr

Welcome to the Saffron Aroma Café Chatbot, Zephyr! Zephyr is a chatbot designed to enhance the user experience on the Saffron Aroma Café website by providing seamless order creation and order tracking functionalities. Here's a brief overview of Zephyr's capabilities:

Order Creation:
1.Zephyr allows users to create new orders directly through chat. Users can add items from the café's menu, specify quantities, and remove items if needed.
2.Zephyr is connected to a backend database that stores information about food items, including their names, prices, and available quantities.

Order Tracking:
Users can track the status of their orders by providing the order ID. Zephyr retrieves the order information from the backend database and displays the current status (e.g., in progress, in transit, completed).

Backend Database Integration:
Zephyr's functionality relies on a backend database that stores information about food items, orders, and their statuses. The database ensures seamless communication between the chatbot and the café's ordering system.

Total Price Calculation:
After finalizing the order, Zephyr calculates the total price based on the selected items and quantities. Users receive a summary of their order, including the total price and unique order ID for reference.
